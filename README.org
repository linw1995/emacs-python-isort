Emacs package to sort Python imports via isort.

* Installation

TODO

* Usage

Use one of these commands via ~M-x~ or bind them to a key:

- ~python-isort-on-save-mode~

  Automatically sort Python imports of the buffer on save.

- ~python-isort-buffer~

  Sort Python imports of the current buffer.

- ~python-isort-region~

  Sort Python imports of the current region.

* Configuration

This package has minimal configuration.

- ~python-isort-command~
- ~python-isort-extra-args~

To configure the =isort= itself, use an [[https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/config_files/][external configuration file]] for your project, which has the best benefits that it can be per-project, and works with other editors or tools as well.
